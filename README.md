# CosmoGAN

Using Generative Adversarial Networks to generate replications of N-Body simulation images. This repository contains the code to solve different problems including (2D, 3D, 2D-time, generation part by parts)

## Installation


### Required packages


*We hightly recommend to work in a virtual environnement.*

You can simply install those packages with the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or if you have no gpu:
```
pip install -r requirements_nogpu.txt
```

For some operations, you may require `pynbody` as it was used to preprocess the simulation. If so, you need to install it separately.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 30 N-body simulations at a scale of 500 MPch and 10 simulations at a scale of 100 Mpch. The dataset is availlable on Zenodo at: URL

To download the dataset, you can simply execute the code:
```
python download_nbody.py
```

## Processing the simulations

TBD

## Example
See the demo notebook for an example

https://github.com/nperraud/CodeGAN/blob/master/WGAN%20demo.ipynb

## Oganisation of the code

The code is composed of a package named *gantools*. It is composed of the following submodules:
* gansystem: implement the basic training and generating system for a gan
* modely: contains the different network architecture
* data: data module
* blocks: basic tensorflow units
* utils: useful functions
* metrics: computation of the different error functions
* plot: helper for the different plots
